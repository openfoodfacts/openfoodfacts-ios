## Building

### Quick & automatic setup
The easiest way to setup the dependencies of the project and generate the Xcode project is to run `sh scripts/setup.sh` from the top of the repository.

### Manual setup
If you prefer to not use the `sh scripts/setup.sh` script and install the dependencies yourself, follow the instructions below.

We use Carthage for dependency management.

Run `carthage bootstrap --platform iOS --cache-builds` before opening the project in Xcode.

You can install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) with Homebrew:
```
brew install carthage
```

To generate the Xcode project run `sh scripts/create-project.sh`.
In order to generate the Xcode project we use [XcodeGen](https://www.github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen).

#### Carthage resources
New to Carthage? Others have found the following resources helpful:
* [Ray Wenderlich's Carthage Tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/416-carthage-tutorial-getting-started)
* [Chris Mendez's Carthage cheat sheet](https://www.chrisjmendez.com/2016/10/30/carthage-cheat-sheet/)
  
### Fastlane
See the fastlane Readme for a list and description of all lanes: [fastlane/README.md](fastlane/README.md)

To launch a lane, you must have several env variable set. This can be done by creating a `.env` file in the `fastlane` folder, and fill it (see `.env.example`)

You can install [Fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) with Homebrew:
```
brew cask install fastlane
```
#### Generating screenshots
```
fastlane snapshot 
```
##### Roadmap on automatic screenshot generation:
- [ ]  fixing the [non translatable scan product button](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-ios/issues/651) so that the screenshot and the app are fully translated
- [ ]  fixing the Scan screenshot generation, and adding a way to set the background of the barcode scanner with an arbitrary image, per country
- [ ]  fixing History screenshot population with products
- [ ]  Adding the proposed fix to clean the top bar with 100% battery, and a fixed time
- [ ]  Adding `fastlane frameit` to the Fastlane file, so that we can get versions wrapped in physical devices
- [ ]  fixing Chinese screenshot generation
- [ ]  Ensure we can generate for 1 of (iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPhone 11, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR), 1 of (iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus), 1 of (3rd generation iPad Pro)
- [ ]  Extra: For debugging purposes, it would be great to have other screen resolutions (iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone X, iPhone XS) (iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, iPhone 7, iPhone 8) (iPhone SE) (iPhone 4s)

### SwiftLint

We have a script that runs when building the app, it executes SwiftLint to enforce a style and conventions to the code.

You can install [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/) with Homebrew:
```
brew install swiftlint
```
