## Building

### Quick & automatic setup
The easiest way to setup the dependencies of the project and generate the Xcode project is to run `sh scripts/setup.sh` from the top of the repository, before opening the project in Xcode. 

#### Dependency Management - Carthage

We currently use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) for dependency management.
New to Carthage? Others have found the following resources helpful:
* [Ray Wenderlich's Carthage Tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/416-carthage-tutorial-getting-started)
* [Chris Mendez's Carthage cheat sheet](https://www.chrisjmendez.com/2016/10/30/carthage-cheat-sheet/)

Before opening the project in Xcode, run 
`
brew install carthage
carthage bootstrap --platform iOS --cache-builds` .

To generate the Xcode project run `sh scripts/create-project.sh`.
In order to generate the Xcode project we use [XcodeGen](https://www.github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen).
  
### Fastlane
See the [fastlane/README.md](fastlane/README.md) for a list and description of all lanes. 

To launch a lane, you must have several env variable set. This can be done by creating a `.env` file in the `fastlane` folder, and fill it (see `.env.example`)

You can install [Fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) with Homebrew:
```
brew cask install fastlane
```
#### Generating screenshots
```
fastlane snapshot 
```
##### Roadmap on automatic screenshot generation:
- [ ]  Create a GitHub Action to run screenshot generation and upload the output to the OFF server (or somewhere else)
- [ ]  fixing the Scan screenshot generation, and adding a way to set the background of the barcode scanner with an arbitrary image, per country
- [ ]  fixing History screenshot population with products
- [ ]  Adding the proposed fix to clean the top bar with 100% battery, and a fixed time
- [ ]  Adding `fastlane frameit` to the Fastlane file, so that we can get versions wrapped in physical devices
- [ ]  fixing Chinese screenshot generation
- [ ]  Ensure we can generate for 1 of (iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPhone 11, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR), 1 of (iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus), 1 of (3rd generation iPad Pro)
- [ ]  Extra: For debugging purposes, it would be great to have other screen resolutions (iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone X, iPhone XS) (iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, iPhone 7, iPhone 8) (iPhone SE) (iPhone 4s)

### Style and conventions - SwiftLint

A script runs when building the app that executes SwiftLint to enforce style & conventions to the code.

You can install [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/) with Homebrew:
```
brew install swiftlint
```
