## Building

### Dependencies
We use Carthage for dependency management.

Run `carthage bootstrap --platform iOS --cache-builds` before opening the project in Xcode.

You can install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) with Homebrew:
```
brew install carthage
```
If installing Carthage this way fails, the GitHub project [provides](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases) .pkg files.
### Fastlane

Currently there are two lanes, one for running the tests (`fastlane test`) and one for uploading a new beta to TestFlight (`fastlane beta`).

You can install [Fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) with Homebrew:
```
brew cask install fastlane
```

### SwiftLint

We have a script that runs when building the app, it executes SwiftLint to enforce a style and conventions to the code.

You can install [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/) with Homebrew:
```
brew install swiftlint
```
